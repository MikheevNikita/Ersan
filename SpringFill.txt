Spring Filling.
This is a tough one, so brace yourself.
A user types in a number and your program makes a two dimensional array, which is then filled with a number sequnce the spring way, so the output should look something like this: 

[ 1][ 2][ 3][ 4][ 5]
[16][17][18][19][ 6]
[15][24][25][20][ 7]
[14][23][22][21][ 8]
[13][12][11][10][ 9]

Hint: It’s a huge “while” loop with some other “while” loops inside it.
